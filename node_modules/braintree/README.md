## Braintree Node library

The Braintree Node library provides integration access to the Braintree Gateway.

## Please Note
> **The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, Braintree is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. Braintree will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. Please see our [technical documentation](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**

## Installation

## Quick Start

```javascript
var braintree = require('braintree');

var gateway = braintree.connect({
  environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
  merchantId: 'your_merchant_id',
  publicKey: 'your_public_key',
  privateKey: 'your_private_key'
});

gateway.transaction.sale({
  amount: '5.00',
  paymentMethodNonce: 'nonce-from-the-client',
  options: {
    submitForSettlement: true
  }
}, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }

  if (result.success) {
    console.log('Transaction ID: ' + result.transaction.id);
  } else {
    console.error(result.message);
  }
});
```

## Promises

You can also use Promises instead of callbacks.

```javascript
var braintree = require('braintree');

var gateway = braintree.connect({
  environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
  merchantId: 'your_merchant_id',
  publicKey: 'your_public_key',
  privateKey: 'your_private_key'
});

gateway.transaction.sale({
  amount: '5.00',
  paymentMethodNonce: 'nonce-from-the-client',
  options: {
    submitForSettlement: true
  }
}).then(function (result) {
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('Transaction ID: ' + result.transaction.id);
  } else {
    console.error(result.message);
  }
}).catch(function (err) {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Almost all methods that uses a callback can alternatively use a Promise. The only exceptions are `gateway.merchantAccount.all` or any of the `search` methods because they return a stream if no callback is provided. 

## Developing (Docker)

The `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` will build an image containing the dependencies and drop you to a terminal where you can run tests.

```
make
```

## Tests

The unit specs can be run by anyone on any system, but the integration specs are meant to be run against a local development server of our gateway code. These integration specs are not meant for public consumption and will likely fail if run on your system. To run unit tests use rake (`rake test:unit`) or npm (`npm test`).
