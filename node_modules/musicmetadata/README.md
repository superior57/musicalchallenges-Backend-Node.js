Streaming music metadata parser for node and the browser.

Installation
------------
Install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
npm install musicmetadata
```

You can also download a pre packaged browser release from `dist/musicmetadata.js`.
See `example/index.html` for usage.


Supports
-----------------
* mp3 (1.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)
* m4a (mp4)
* vorbis (ogg, flac)
* asf (wma, wmv)


API
-----------------
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var mm = require('musicmetadata');

// create a new parser from a node ReadStream
var parser = mm(fs.createReadStream('sample.mp3'), function (err, metadata) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(metadata);
});
```

This will output the standard music metadata:

```javascript
{ artist : ['Spor'],
  album : 'Nightlife, Vol 5.',
  albumartist : [ 'Andy C', 'Spor' ],
  title : 'Stronger',
  year : '2010',
  track : { no : 1, of : 44 },
  disk : { no : 1, of : 2 },
  genre : ['Drum & Bass'],
  picture : [ { format : 'jpg', data : <Buffer> } ],
  duration : 302.41 // in seconds
}
```

Note, the stream is not closed by default. To prevent leaks, you must close it yourself:
```javascript
var readableStream = fs.createReadStream('sample.mp3');
var parser = mm(readableStream, function (err, metadata) {
  if (err) throw err;
  readableStream.close();
});
```

`musicmetadata` also emits all metadata it discovers during parsing. For example if you wanted to read the `TLEN` frame from an id3v2.x file you can do this:

```javascript
parser.on('TLEN', function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

You can also read the duration; to calculate the duration `musicmetadata` may need to parse the entire file
so only enable this if you need the functionality.
```javascript
mm(fs.createReadStream('sample.mp3'), { duration: true }, function (err, metadata) {

});
```

Note that in order to read the duration for streams that are not file streams, you must also pass the size of the file in bytes.
```javascript
mm(fs.createReadStream('sample.mp3'), { duration: true, fileSize: 26838 }, function (err, metadata) {

});
```
